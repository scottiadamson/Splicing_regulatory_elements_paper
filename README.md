Preporcessed data which is used as inputs for this repository will be hosted at [Zenodo]()
Raw data generated for this study is available through GEO under the accession [GSE164752](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE164752)
Scripts for generating the preprocessed data are available in the "preprocessing_scripts" directory, however will require modification in order to be run properly as most of them are originally from an HPC environment

Interested in using this modified version of Vex-seq or the original on your own data?
Here are links to detailed experimental protocols for the [original]() and [updated]() versions
